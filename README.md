# Social Network API

## Description

This API allows front end developers to create, read, update and delete users, thoughts and reactions for a social media platform.

- What was your motivation?
- I built this project to learn about Mongoose going into learning the MERN stack
- This solves the problem of allowing users to store thoughts and reactions in a database to share and look back on.
- I learned the basics of Mongoose and how to work with it using Express.
